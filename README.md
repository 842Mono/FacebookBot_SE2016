# TheBot

To clone the app with heroku try using this:

`heroku git:clone -a pacific-peak-81142`

then you should be able to make commits as usual. Then to push your changes to heroku server try:

`git push heroku master`

I think we don't need to use github at all, but I added the code as a github repo here anyway


Anyways I think you can add the github remote like this

`git remote add github https://github.com/842Mono/TheBot.git`

Then you can also push to github the same way as usual

`git push github master`
